# 📊 Employee Absenteeism Analysis
🔹 Project Overview

This project analyzes employee absenteeism by first cleaning and preparing raw data using Python (Pandas), and then visualizing insights with Power BI.

The key difference in this project is that after data cleaning, the dataset was transformed and modified further based on business reporting requirements, so the final dataset used in Power BI differs slightly from the raw one.

Developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI for business insights:

📈 Absenteeism Trends by Year & Month – to track changes over time.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Absenteeism by Family Type – children, no children, pets, etc.

🧑‍🎓 Absenteeism by Education Level – UG vs PG.

📊 Absenteeism by Age Group & Day of Week – to capture working patterns.

🩺 Absenteeism by Reasons – Illness, Transport, Childcare, Other.

📌 KPIs – Total Employees, Average Transportation Cost, Avg Absenteeism Hours, Total Absenteeism Hours.
🔹 Insights
